# Museum of Memes

## Description

This website is a display of only the greatest memes! Users are able to browse through the memes displayed in the table towards the top of the page and click on them to get a closer look. If truly inspired, users can create their own memes using the provided template. You can create an account and even add them to the collection so that everyone can whitness its glory. While you're logged in, only you can be the one to delete or rename your meme. If that's too much of a commitment, feel free to continue as a guest! As a guest, you can still create your own memes and save them to your device, but you will not be able to add your masterpiece to the museum.
