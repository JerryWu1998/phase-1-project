# Museum of Memes

## Description

This website is a display of only the greatest memes! Users are able to browse through the memes displayed in the table towards the top of the page and click on them to get a closer look. If they are truly inspired, users can create their own memes using the provided template and even add them to the collection so that everyone can whitness it. You can either create your own account so that when you create a new meme while you're logged in, only you can be the one to delete it. If that's too much of a commitment, feel free to continue as a guest! As a guest, you can still create your own memes and save them to your device, but you will not be able to add your masterpiece to the museum.
